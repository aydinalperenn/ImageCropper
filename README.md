#Image Editor – Batch Image Cropper (WinForms)

This project is a Windows Forms–based desktop application that allows users to load images from a folder sequentially and crop them interactively using mouse drag operations. While selecting the crop area, the application provides a real-time preview of the resulting image resolution.

For each image, the application displays the image order, original resolution, and filename. Cropped images are saved as copies into an automatically created "Cropped" folder within the selected directory, using the original filename with an appended suffix. This workflow enables fast, controlled, and organized batch image cropping.

The project is developed using pure C# and WinForms, without any external dependencies.
